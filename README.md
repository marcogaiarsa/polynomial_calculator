# Polynomial Calculator
Simple tk app to make operations on univariant polynomials.
# How to use
## Basic Inputs
Once the app is started, the main window presents buttons for adding two polynomials. Pressing a button opens a new window for creating the polynomial. Add the value for each degree for x in turn, pressing "next degree" to enter input. Zero is a valid input and and will get the program to the next degree, but there will be no display for the x in that particular degree. Once you finish a polynomial, press "end polynomial" to pass into main window. 

## Operations
Once both basic polynomial are given. Press "Go to operations" to open a new window that will show the polynomials as arguments and the possible functions as buttons, apply them at will. The operation "invert" allows to make the first polynomial the second and vice-verso, while the "Result as B" operation takes the result of the previous function and makes it into the second polynomial. The remaining functions are as defined in the ring of univariant polynomials, in this case I should say over the structure of the floats.
